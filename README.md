dotfiles
========

My dotfiles setup. For personal use, but feel free to modify for your purpose.

**Note**: Still very much work in progress. At the time of writing none of the features mentioned below have been implemented.

# Features

- Install simple dotfiles to different targets (FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Debian)
- Install my .vimrc and .vim files
- Secrets installed from gpg encrypted store
- Tools to manage targets and gpg stores
